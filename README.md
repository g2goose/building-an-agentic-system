# The Agentic Systems Series

A comprehensive guide to building production-ready AI coding assistants, from local tools to enterprise platforms.

## Overview

This two-book series provides practical engineering patterns for building AI coding assistants based on analysis of real production systems including Claude Code, Amp, and open-source implementations.

**Book 1: Building an Agentic System**

- Core architecture patterns for AI coding assistants
- Reactive terminal UIs with streaming responses
- Tool systems and permission models
- Parallel execution strategies

**Book 2: Amping Up an Agentic System**

- Scaling from single-user to collaborative platforms
- Enterprise authentication and team workflows
- Real-time synchronization patterns
- Production deployment strategies

## For Engineers

Written for software engineers building AI-powered development tools, with focus on:

- Practical patterns over theory
- Real architectural decisions
- Production-ready implementations
